Worst Case scenario Time Complexities:
Task0 : O(1)		:	Getting last value in list will have O(1) complexity 
Task1 : O(n)		:	4 For loops in sequence with O(n) complexity
Task2 : O(n)		:	traverse till end (nth value) of 2D list to get the 3rd column. 
Task3 : O(nlogn)	:	For loop if having O(n) and  if loop is having O(k) and sorting is having O(nlogn) all are in sequential so highest will be considered. 
Task4 : O(nlogn)	:	Sort is the most time consuming with O(nlogn) rest all are O(n) in sequence
